                    <p>I didn't really have much time to properly program
                    the <b>micro:bot</b> (that's what I decided to call it), but
                    I did construct a brother for it, <b>micro:bob</b>.</p>
                    <p><img class="figure" src="../photo/IMG_20151126_134204.jpg"></p>
                    <p>This one is a walking robot based on the popular Bob
                    design. It has four servos, but two of them are connected
                    to the same signal pin, so I can control it with just the
                    three pins that are available as large pads. I didn't have
                    another small breadboard, so instead I used a servo
                    breakout board that I had lying around. A veroboard would
                    work as well. The rest is just some pieces of soft plastic
                    and a lot of hot glue.</p>
                    <p>Tomorrow I will try to program both robots to do
                    something interesting.</p>

                    <p>I received Monifa, and put it on the robot in Mahiri's
                    place. Then I tried to get the robot going, but ran into
                    some problems with the PWM signal from the <b>micro:bit</b>.</p>
                    <p>It turned out to be two separate problems. One is that
                    setting the PWM period doesn't seem to work reliably at the
                    moment. I actually went to my local hackerspace and used
                    their osciloscope to look at the signal:</p>
                    <p><img class="figure" src="../photo/IMG_20151124_203956.jpg"></p>
                    <p>Hopefully that will be fixed before it's shipped.</p>
                    <p>The other problem was powering the servos with 3V from
                    the two AAA batteries that I have used. Turns out that servos
                    rated for 4.6V don't really like that. I replaced the batteries
                    with a 3.7V LiPo battery, and now it works much better.</p>
                    <p><img class="figure" src="../photo/IMG_20151125_105637s.jpg"></p>
                    <p>I also figured out how to append the Python script at the end
                    of the hex file with the firmware. Turns out that after you run
                    it through the "hexlify.py" script and append at the end, you
                    still need to find and move the "end of file" line, which looks like this:</p>
                    <pre>:00000001FF</pre>
                    <p>Then just drag-and-drop the file into <b>micro:bit</b>, and the robot
                    can go on its own:</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Now I just need to make it use that sensor (and maybe the compass too?).</p>
                    <p>By the way, I also got an edge connector, to get to all the other pins on this board. After some assembly, it looks like this:</p>
                    <p><img class="figure" src="../photo/IMG_20151124_154459.jpg"></p>
                    <p>I like how they added the three rows of pins at the
                    bottom, for easily connecting your own stuff. But I hate
                    that they got the order of the two power rows wrong. It
                    should be ground-power-signal, from the top, not
                    power-ground-signal. This way you cannot connect RC hobby
                    servos to this or other common sensors (ground-power-signal
                    is a kind of a standard). Oh well.</p>
