                    <p>After yesterday's failure I couldn't sleep. Monifa
                    was already packed up, ready to be sent to the next
                    person in the morning, and I spent the night reading
                    the I2C specification and Atmel's notes on TWI on AVR.</p>
                    <p>In the morning, after reading all the helpful messages
                    on the issue that I reported, I decided to quickly give
                    it one more try, as I got one idea that might possibly work.
                    It turns out, that the address of the I2C device can be
                    specified in two formats. I used the more common 7 bit
                    format, but there is also the 8 bit format. Sure enough,
                    micro:bit uses the latter format, and when I shifted by
                    I2C address to the left one bit, everything suddenly worked.</p>
                    <p>Don't worry, this will be fixed soon, and micro:bit
                    will be using the more popular 7 bit format, just like
                    Arduino and Raspberry Pi do.</p>
                    <p>But that was just the beginning of the work. I could
                    move the individual servos of the robot, but I wanted it
                    to walk. So I wrote a quick e-mail to the person who was
                    supposed to get Monifa after me, apologizing for the delay,
                    and worked on it some more in the evening.</p>
                    <p>I will spare you the tale of the frustrating hours of
                    tuning the positions and getting the inverse kinematics
                    calculations right. I have done it many times before, but
                    somehow it haven't become easier. Finally, I could control
                    the position of each leg individually and of all of them
                    at once:<p>
                    <div class="video-container">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VZ7vxIEno0o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>But the work is not finished yet. Next comes programming
                    the actual walking. I decided to start with the creep gait,
                    which is statically stable and slow -- perfect for testing.
                    I wrote all the code that was supposed to move the robot,
                    and got a <i>MemoryError</i>. The poor Monifa simply couldn't
                    remember all the things I made it do. Sigh. I went over
                    all the code and optimized what I could. Finally, after
                    squashing some additional bugs that crept in there, my
                    code kinda worked when run from the Python console. So I
                    added a few lines to make it run by default, so that I
                    could unplug the robot from the computer and make it
                    walk on its own. And I got a <i>RuntimeError: maximum
                    recursion depth exceeded.</i> So I went over the code
                    again, flattening what I could and inlining functions
                    and methods. Finally, I got it to walk:</p>
                    <div class="video-container">

                    </div>
                    <p>I know, it looks very sick and weak. That's probably
                    how it feels too. It was a quick hack, and there is a
                    lot I had to remove or simplify. I'm also sure that a
                    lot could be improved. But I got it done and the next
                    person is waiting, so Monifa goes on its way today.</p>

                    <p>I finally found some time to work on connecting the
                    micro:bit to my super-cheap quadruped robot, <a
                        href="http://tote.rtfd.org">Tote</a>.</p> <p>Since I
                    need to control a dozen servomechanisms here, I decided
                    that it's best to not connect them directly to micro:bit
                    pins (it seems that the current build of Micropython can
                    only do PWM output on the analog pins, and there are only
                    six of those), but instead to program the Arduino that
                    normally controls them to listen over I2C connection, and
                    move the servos to the positions that it gets from there.
                    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/tote/src/tip/i2cslave/"
                    >I already had the code for that</a>, because that's how I
                    plan to connect a Raspberry Pi to it later on.<p>
                    <p>So uploaded the firmware to the robot, and connected the
                    I2C lines to the micro:bit:</p>
                    <p><img class="figure" src="../photo/IMG_20151129_114407.jpg"></p>
                    <p>Then I connected the micro:bit to USB and tried those
                    commands:</p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint">
import ustruct
import math
from microbit import i2c

i2c.write(0x04, ustruct.pack('bf', 0, math.radians(45)))
                    </pre>
                    <p>This should have moved the tip of the font left leg by
                    45Â° forward. But nothing happened. Not even an error.</p>
                    <p>Surprised, I tried the same thing with a Raspberry Pi:</p>
                    <p><img class="figure" src="../photo/IMG_20151129_123810.jpg"></p>
                    <p>This time it worked correctly. It seems that there are
                    still some problems in the I2C support on the
                    micro:bit. Unfortunately, this means I will not be able to
                    control my robot with it just yet. I have to send Monifa
                    on its way to the next person on the list, so I guess the
                    next opportunity I will have to try it is when micro:bit
                    is released to the general public, provided I will be able
                    to buy one.</p>

                    <p>Today was a programming day. I sat down and wrote the
                    code that controls both <b>micro:bot</b> and <b>micro:bob</b>.
                    The <b>micro:bob</b> is quite simple &mdash; it only has
                    a preprogrammed sequence of leg movements for walking.
                    I made a <code>Servo</code> class for convenience, and
                    then some functions for making a step with left and right
                    legs. I also added some faces. I should probably also add
                    some turning and maybe a small dance, but I was pressed for
                    time, so I left that for some other time. For now, behold,
                    <b>micro:bob</b> walking:</p>
                    <div class="video-container">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/khRb_HOsX6c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>The small shaking at the beginning is there to work
                    around a bug with the PWM signal. Hopefully this will get
                    fixed and won't be needed anymore.</p>
                    <p>You can also see that the robot twitches a little when
                    it's just standing still. That's another bug in the PWM.</p>
                    <p>All the code is available in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micro-bob/src">micro:bob
                    repository</a>.</p>
                    <p>Next comes the <b>micro:bot</b>. I already had it riding
                    across my room, but now it's time to add some intelligence.
                    I started by checking how fast it goes straight and rotates,
                    so that I could use proper timing for the commands that make
                    it go a specified distance and turn a specified angle. Having
                    done that, I proceeded to calibrate the distance sensor it
                    has mounted at the front (just a simple SHARP sensor from
                    Pololu, but note that it has to run on 3V). Then I coded
                    a simple obstacle avoidance procedure: if the distance
                    sensor shows an obstacle less than about 10cm ahead, then
                    stop, turn 20Â° to the left, check the distance, turn back
                    and 20Â° the right, check distance, turn back, compare the
                    two distances and turn 60Â° in the direction that has more
                    free space. It works surprisingly well, as long as the
                    robot doesn't hit something that it didn't see:</p>

                    <p>The code is in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micro-bob/src">micro:bot repository</a>.</p>
                    <p>All in all, it was quite fun to use the <b>micro:bit</b> and I hope the kids will have fun too.</p>
                    <p>As the last thing, I will try to make it control <a href="http://tote.rtfd.org">Tote</a>, a quadruped robot that I'm developing.</p>

                    <p>I didn't really have much time to properly program
                    the <b>micro:bot</b> (that's what I decided to call it), but
                    I did construct a brother for it, <b>micro:bob</b>.</p>
                    <p><img class="figure" src="../photo/IMG_20151126_134204.jpg"></p>
                    <p>This one is a walking robot based on the popular Bob
                    design. It has four servos, but two of them are connected
                    to the same signal pin, so I can control it with just the
                    three pins that are available as large pads. I didn't have
                    another small breadboard, so instead I used a servo
                    breakout board that I had lying around. A veroboard would
                    work as well. The rest is just some pieces of soft plastic
                    and a lot of hot glue.</p>
                    <p>Tomorrow I will try to program both robots to do
                    something interesting.</p>

                    <p>I received Monifa, and put it on the robot in Mahiri's
                    place. Then I tried to get the robot going, but ran into
                    some problems with the PWM signal from the <b>micro:bit</b>.</p>
                    <p>It turned out to be two separate problems. One is that
                    setting the PWM period doesn't seem to work reliably at the
                    moment. I actually went to my local hackerspace and used
                    their osciloscope to look at the signal:</p>
                    <p><img class="figure" src="../photo/IMG_20151124_203956.jpg"></p>
                    <p>Hopefully that will be fixed before it's shipped.</p>
                    <p>The other problem was powering the servos with 3V from
                    the two AAA batteries that I have used. Turns out that servos
                    rated for 4.6V don't really like that. I replaced the batteries
                    with a 3.7V LiPo battery, and now it works much better.</p>
                    <p><img class="figure" src="../photo/IMG_20151125_105637s.jpg"></p>
                    <p>I also figured out how to append the Python script at the end
                    of the hex file with the firmware. Turns out that after you run
                    it through the "hexlify.py" script and append at the end, you
                    still need to find and move the "end of file" line, which looks like this:</p>
                    <pre>:00000001FF</pre>
                    <p>Then just drag-and-drop the file into <b>micro:bit</b>, and the robot
                    can go on its own:</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Now I just need to make it use that sensor (and maybe the compass too?).</p>
                    <p>By the way, I also got an edge connector, to get to all the other pins on this board. After some assembly, it looks like this:</p>
                    <p><img class="figure" src="../photo/IMG_20151124_154459.jpg"></p>
                    <p>I like how they added the three rows of pins at the
                    bottom, for easily connecting your own stuff. But I hate
                    that they got the order of the two power rows wrong. It
                    should be ground-power-signal, from the top, not
                    power-ground-signal. This way you cannot connect RC hobby
                    servos to this or other common sensors (ground-power-signal
                    is a kind of a standard). Oh well.</p>
